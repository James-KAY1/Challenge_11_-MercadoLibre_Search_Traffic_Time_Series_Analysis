# Challenge_11_-MercadoLibre_Search_Traffic_Time_Series_Analysis
For this challenge the objective was to create a Jupyter notebook that analyzed MercadoLibre a Latin America e-commerce site company's financials and user data to find out if customer's search traffic about the company can translate into ways for the company to improve their marketing plans and to predict if the search traffic can forecast optimal times to trade the company's stock.
